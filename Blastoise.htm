<h1>Blastoise</h1>

<h2>Did you know that over 70% of the earth is covered
with water?<br>More space for Blastoise that way.</h2>

<p>
So here it is. the obligatory Blastoise page. Blastoise isn't all <strong>that</strong> bad. I mean, 
he's got the cannons on his back right? 
    

</p>



<p>
Those are pretty cool. But, of course, not as cool as 
Venusaur or Charizard. If you think about it, Blastoise is the only 1st Gen starter that 
did not receive dual typing. That would be my guess as to why there was no blue remake but 
a <span class="leafgreen">Leaf Green</span> 3rd Gen remake. </p>



<p>
It is important to remember what type we are dealing with. While Blastoise 
does have awesome cannons and a bulky look with its shell, Blastoise is a water 
type. I mean no intentional discrimination with this statement. Water is a cool 
type, but water type starters suffer greatly from being forced into the most over-populated 
type. Water type pokemon make up roughly 16% of all pokemon. With so many water types 
there was bound to be some overlap. The most obvious example of this would be Blastoise 
and Feraligatr; their base stat total is the same, their type is the same, their competitive 
smogon rank is the same, and the are back to back in the generation line up. Speaking of competitive rank, 
4 out of 6 of the water starters are Under-used. We can see the compensation for the lack 
of formidable water starters with the appearance of Greninja.</p>

<p>
Greninja is a monster. With Greninja's breakneck speed and killer speacial attack 
topped of with its hidden ability <em>Protean</em>, Greninja was built to put Blaziken 
in its place.</p>
